          Powerful and reliable, the AK-47 is one of the most popular assault
          rifles in the world. It is most deadly in short, controlled bursts of
          fire. It has been custom painted with a "HEAD SHOT GUN" graffiti and
          finished with pearlescent coating. Everyone has goals, but are you
          willing to put in the work to achieve them? - Booth, Arms Dealer
