          With its curved blade mimicking a tiger's claw, the karambit was
          developed as part of the southeast Asian martial discipline of silat.
          The knife is typically used with a reverse grip, with the finger ring
          on the index finger. It has been painted with black and silver
          metallic paints using a marbleizing medium, then candy coated. Getting
          lost in its color can prove fatal
